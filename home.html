        <h3>Overview</h3> 
     <p class="para-1">
       <br> <br>
        Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance taste, appearance, or other sensory qualities. Some additives have been used for centuries as part of an effort to preserve food, for example vinegar (pickling), salt (salting), smoke (smoking), sugar (crystallization), etc. This allows for longer-lasting foods such as bacon, sweets or wines. With the advent of ultra-processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. Food additives also include substances that may be introduced to food indirectly (called "indirect additives") in the manufacturing process, through packaging, or during storage or transport.
       <br> <br>
        Many different food additives have been developed over time to meet the needs of large-scale food processing. Additives are added to ensure processed food remains safe and in 
        good condition throughout its journey from factories or industrial kitchens, to warehouses and shops, and finally to consumers. Additives are also used to modify the sensory properties of foods including taste, smell, texture and appearance. 
        Food additives can be derived from plants, animals or minerals, or they can be chemically synthesized. There are several thousand food additives used, all of which are designed to do a specific job. Food additives can be grouped into 3 broad categories based on their function.

        <h3 class="title2">Safety And Regulation</h3> 
        <p class="para-2">
        <br><br><br><br>
        With the increasing use of processed foods since the 19th century, food additives are more widely used. Many countries regulate their use. For example, boric acid was widely used as a food preservative from the 1870s to the 1920s, but was banned after World War I due to its toxicity, as demonstrated in animal and human studies. During World War II, the urgent need for cheap, available food preservatives led to it being used again, but it was finally banned in the 1950s. Such cases led to a general mistrust of food additives, and an application of the precautionary principle led to the conclusion that only additives that are known to be safe should be used in foods. In the United States, this led to the adoption of the Delaney clause, an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, stating that no carcinogenic substances may be used as food additives. <br> <br> However, after the banning of cyclamates in the United States and Britain in 1969, saccharin, the only remaining legal artificial sweetener at the time, was found to cause cancer in rats. Widespread public outcry in the United States, partly communicated to Congress by postage-paid postcards supplied in the packaging of sweetened soft drinks, led to the retention of saccharin, despite its violation of the Delaney clause. However, in 2000, saccharin was found to be carcinogenic in rats due only to their unique urine chemistry.
        In 2007, Food Standards Australia New Zealand published an official shoppers' guidance with which the concerns of food additives and their labeling are mediated.In the EU it can take 10 years or more to obtain approval for a new food additive. This includes five years of safety testing, followed by two years for evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and another three years before the additive receives an EU-wide approval for use in every country in the European Union. Apart from testing and analyzing food products during the whole production process to ensure safety and compliance with regulatory standards, Trading Standards officers (in the UK) protect the public from any illegal use or potentially dangerous mis-use of food additives by performing random testing of food products.
        There has been significant controversy associated with the risks and benefits of food additives. Natural additives may be similarly harmful or be the cause of allergic reactions in certain individuals. For example, safrole was used to flavor root beer until it was shown to be carcinogenic. Due to the application of the Delaney clause, it may not be added to foods, even though it occurs naturally in sassafras and sweet basil.

        <h3 class="title2">Numbering of Food Additives</h3> 
        <p class="para-2">
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Food additives are substances added to food to enhance its flavor, appearance, or preservation qualities. These additives are systematically named and numbered to provide a standardized way of identifying them across different countries and regulatory bodies. Here’s an overview of the naming and numbering of food additives: <br>
            <br>
        Numbering of Food Additives : <br>
        <br>
        The numbering of food additives follows an international system, often referred to as the "E number" system in Europe. The E number system is managed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). <br> Here’s a breakdown of how these numbers are assigned: <br>
        1.	E100–E199 (Colors): Additives used to impart color to food.
        2.	E200–E299 (Preservatives): Additives that help preserve food by preventing microbial growth. <br>
        3.	E300–E399 (Antioxidants, Acidity Regulators): Additives that prevent oxidation or control the acidity/alkalinity of food. <br>
        4.	E400–E499 (Thickeners, Stabilizers, Emulsifiers): Additives that improve the texture and consistency of food. <br>
        5.	E500–E599 (Acidity Regulators, Anti-caking Agents): Additives that control pH or prevent clumping in powdered food.<br>
        6.	E600–E699 (Flavor Enhancers): Additives that enhance the taste or aroma of food.<br>
        7.	E700–E799 (Antibiotics): Rarely used, but these are additives that can prevent bacterial growth in food.<br>
        8.	E900–E999 (Miscellaneous): Includes a variety of additives such as sweeteners, foaming agents, and glazing agents.<br>
        9.	E1000–E1599 (Additional chemicals): A further range of additives including newer additions and those with more specific functions.<br>

        <br><br><br><br>
        TRANS FATS : <br>
        <br>
        Trans fat has been a popular nutrition buzzword for the past 15 years or so.  They’re created when companies add hydrogen to oil during the manufacturing process, which can change the texture and extend the shelf life of foods.  The problem is that consuming trans fats has been shown to increase the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke.
        When reading labels at the grocery store, try to avoid foods that list hydrogenated oil (or any slight variation) as an ingredient. <br>
        <br>
        SODIUM NITRITE :  <br>
        <br>
        Sodium nitrate is typically found in processed meats like canned tuna, sausages, and deli meat.  Some studies have shown that consuming too much sodium nitrite can lead to pancreatic cancer and other significant health problems.  <br>
        <br>
        MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG):  <br>
        <br>
        MSG is naturally created from a chemical called glutamate and looks similar to sugar or salt.  It can enhance the flavor of savory dishes and is usually found in Chinese food and fast food. <br>
        <br>
        MSG has gotten a bad rap for years, with numerous claims in the late 1960s alleging that food prepared with MSG at Chinese restaurants made people sick; however, many studies report difficulty in finding concrete evidence that there is a problem with MSG. At the same time, some reports have indicated numerous reactions such as headaches, flushing, sweating, facial pressure or tightness, numbness, tingling or burning in the face, neck and other areas, rapid, heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea, and weakness.  <br>
        <br>
        While the jury is still out as to how harmful MSG truly is, it’s probably best to limit how much you consume.  The easiest way to do that is by limiting processed meats, fast food, and Chinese takeout.  <br>
        <br>
        ARTIFICIAL FOOD COLORING:  <br>
        <br>
        Artificial food colors are chemicals used to color food and drinks.  Most processed foods have at least a few of these colorings.  The most harmful food colorings are:  <br>
        <br>
        •	Yellow # 5  <br>
        •	Blue #1 and Blue #2  <br>
        •	Red Dye #3 <br>
        •	Yellow #6 <br>
        •	Natural Green Color <br>
        <br>
        HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP :  <br>
        <br>
        High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is popular with food companies simply because its cheaper than cane sugar, but still provides the sweet taste consumers want.  It’s believed that HFCS can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes.  <br>
        <br>
        In the US, HFCS is found in tons of food products, and not just the sweet ones.  Frozen pizza, cocktail peanuts, cereal, and even bread often contain HFCS.  <br>
        <br>
        ASPARTAME :  <br>
        <br>
        Aspartame an artificial sweetener commonly found is diet or sugar-free sodas, chewing gum, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, and sometimes even chewable vitamins.  It’s almost 200x sweeter than cane sugar, so manufacturers don’t have to use as much of it.  <br>
        <br>
        Numerous studies have shown that aspartame can increase blood glucose levels, and may even cause anxiety. <br>
        <br>
        BHA & BHT :  <br>
        <br>
        Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are preservatives found in cereals, chewing gum, potato chips, and vegetable oils. This common preservative keeps foods from changing color, changing the flavor or becoming rancid. Affects the neurological system of the brain, alters behavior and has a potential to cause cancer. BHA and BHT are oxidants that form cancer-causing reactive compounds in your body.

        <h3 class="title2">Side-Affects</h3> 
        <p class="para-2">
        <br><br><br><br>
        For most people, additives are not a problem in the short term. However, 50 of the 400 currently approved additives in Australia have been associated with adverse reactions in some people. Some food additives are more likely than others to cause reactions in sensitive people.
            <br> <br>
        It is often the additives that are used to give a food a marketable quality, such as colour, that most commonly cause allergic reactions. Some of these hypersensitive reactions include: <br>
        <br>
        •	Digestive disorders – diarrhoea and colicky pains <br>
        •	Nervous disorders – hyperactivity, insomnia and irritability <br>
        •	Respiratory problems – asthma, rhinitis and sinusitis <br>
        •	Skin problems – hives, itching, rashes and swelling.<br>
        <br>
        It is important to realise that many of the symptoms experienced as a result of food sensitivities can be caused by other disorders. Medical diagnosis is important. If you try to diagnose yourself, you may restrict your diet unnecessarily and neglect an illness.
